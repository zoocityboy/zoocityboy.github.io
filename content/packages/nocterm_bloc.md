summary: Pragmatic Bloc helpers and small utilities for terminal-first or minimal UI Dart projects.

---

nocterm_bloc grew out of the desire to keep state management lean in projects that prioritize simplicity and developer ergonomics — especially terminal-first tools, CLIs, and tiny UIs. Rather than re-invent Bloc patterns, it provides a small collection of helpers, extensions, and utility classes that make common patterns less verbose.

Why it was created

- Simplicity: Many teams want the predictability of Bloc without ceremony.
- Conventions: Provide a few well-documented conventions for event/state shaping so codebases remain consistent.
- Tooling: Includes simple test helpers and a couple of utilities to wire up Blocs in constrained environments (CLI apps, short-lived processes).

Example usage

```dart
import 'package:nocterm_bloc/nocterm_bloc.dart';

class CounterEvent {}
class Increment extends CounterEvent {}

class CounterState {
  final int value;
  CounterState(this.value);
}

class CounterBloc extends SimpleBloc<CounterEvent, CounterState> {
  CounterBloc() : super(CounterState(0)) {
    on<Increment>((event, emit) => emit(CounterState(state.value + 1)));
  }
}

final bloc = CounterBloc();
bloc.add(Increment());
```

When to use

Choose nocterm_bloc when your app needs predictable state transitions but you want to avoid heavy scaffolding. It's especially useful in microservices, CLI tools, or small web components where quick feedback loops matter.
